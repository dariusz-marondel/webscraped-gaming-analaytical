### Food for thought
Every project needs a reliable data storage. We, people of corporate world (and not only us) are used to tabular form of the data. Its simple, easy to understand, allows for creating relations between data, and it is very intuitive to analyse. 

While any casual person asked about data tables solution will probably answer 'Excel', let me be very clear that this is the very first and the very last time that this name appears in this repository. The word 'database' may seem frightening at first but I assure you there is nothing to worry about it. Relational databases are the very tables you know and love and I would love to change you thinking that SQL DB is reserved only for cool people with proggraming skills. 

### Considerations
The project is very simple so I elected to go for the simplies solution possible - SQLite database. 

Pros: 
1. Its consist of one file 
2. Does store different tables as good as any other system
3. I don't have to pay Amazon for virtual machine (a space on server that would make the DB accessible at any times)
4. Its integrated in base version of Python - language that will be widely used in this repo

Cons: 
None!
