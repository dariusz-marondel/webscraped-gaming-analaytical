# League statistics project with scheduled API calls, analytics and report creation
I designed the project to present combined skills of different domains that come of use in a data analyst work. Its intention is to be a 'portfolio' project, however regardless of who the reader is - a recruiter or not - I hope you will enjoy!

## 'Business' problem
Me and a group of my friends are going to play clash in league of legends this weekend. What an excitement! So many players from entire european server are going to fight for the crown, and title of clash conqueror! But after some thinking about what champions we are going to play, we have realised that with all of us swamped with our jobs, we have not played league in some time. Consequently, we have no idea what is 'meta' now; i.e. what champions should we pull out of pocket to ensure highest possible chances for success. 

## Approach to solution 
As I have some spare time in the evenings (god bless no overtime this time!) I decided to pull some data from Riot Games API to prepare some report on our respective champion pools. I have decided that since we may play some clash again in the future and evenings without overtime are not to be taken for granted (!), it is better to already prepare the automation of the report regardless of its simplicity (or maybe even more willingly taking that into account). <br>

I inquired my friends of required data and began working. 

## Goal of the project
The projects contain of scheduled workflows pulling data from Riot games developer API, then transforming it to make some beautiful (reasonably!) report(s) with some simple insights. I aim to explain all as clear as possible so even non-technical people could find it interesting but also to demonstrate ability to communicate without overcomplicating things. 

Project is intended to display my skill in few technologies combined such as:
1. SQL 
2. API calls
3. Data handling
4. Docker
5. Airflow
6. Python
7. Data visualisation

and hopefully more.

## Technicals

1. Project was developed using 'Pycharm CE v2024.3.1.1' and 'Visual Studio Code v1.95.3'
2. It was published first and only on this gitHub - amberlights-py/XX - 
3. Its core is 'Python 3.8.10 ' to ensure maximum compatibility with Airflow as specified in its documentation.
4. 'Apache Airflow v2.10.4' - https://tinyurl.com/airflow-apache
5. Docker v4.37.2
6. Data if no specified otherwise, was pulled from Riot Developer APIs - https://developer.riotgames.com
7. DataGrip v2024.3.3 for database operations

From gitHub with love
