# Simple stats project with scheduled API calls, analytics and report creation
I designed the project to present combined skills of different domains that come of use in a data analyst work. Its intention is to be a 'portfolio' project, however regardless of who the reader is - a recruiter or not - I hope you will enjoy!

## 'Business' problem
Me and my friends are going to play clash in league of legends this weekend. What an excitement! So many players from entire european server are going to fight for the crown, and title of clash conqueror! But after some thinking about what champions we are going to play, we have realised that with all of us swamped with our jobs, we have not played league in some time. Consequently we have no idea what is 'meta' now; i.e. what champions should we pull out of pocket to ensure highest possible chances for success. 

## Approach to solution 
As I have some spare time in the evenings (god bless no overtime this time!) I decided to pull some data from Riot Games API to prepare some report on our respective champion pools. I have decided that since we may play some clash again in the future and evenings without overtime are not to be taken for granted (!), it is better to already prepare the automation of the report regardles of its simplicity (or maybe even more willingly taking that into account). <br>

I inquired my friends of required data and began working. 

## Technicals of the project
The projects contains of scheduled workflows pullind data from Riot games developer API, and then transforming it to make some beutiful (reasonably!) report with some simple insigts. I aim to explain all as clear as possible so even non-technical people could find it interesting but also to demonstrate ability to communicate without overcomplicating things. 

Project is intended to display my skill in few technologies combined such as:
1. SQL 
2. API calls
3. Data handling
4. Docker
5. Airflow
6. Python
7. Data visualisation

and hopefuly more.

From github with love
