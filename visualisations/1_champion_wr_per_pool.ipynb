    "Having established what are our respective champion pools and loaded them into a table I can begin the analysis from simply determining our champion winrate. It will give my friends and myself a reqlity check on which of our favorite champions are currently the best choice. Fan-favorite statistic is a specific's champion win rate meaning percentage of game swon with that champion in relation to all games played by that champion. With hundred of thousands of League's players playing every day there is a good chance that after only a few days we have enough data to adapt an assumption that winrate does not occur due to some random events but rather a systematic effect of changes made by game's development team that adjust champions and items in game. \n",

    "In this analysis we use data from real matches in ranked soloq leagues from Platinum IV to Diamond I. Data is pulled from Riot Developer API endpoints using a development key. It was achieved by pulling data from various endpoints, tranforming their responses and based on that reposonses I have been able to create a table of random 10,000 games played since last patch (changes made to game that can potentialy impact champion winrate). All technical are desribed in comments of files contained in the directory `api_calls`. \n",
